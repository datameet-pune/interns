## Welcome

Tasks list : [Click here](https://github.com/datameet-pune/datameet-pune.github.io/wiki/Tasks-for-Interns)

This will be the virtual office for all the interns. If you're not on a repo of your own, you may use this environment to post your work files and to do the documentation of your work. This is a place for hosting work-in-progress work. Once completed, it will be forked (copied) over to the main [Datameet Pune](https://github.com/datameet-pune/datameet-pune.github.io) repo as final. On this repo, all the interns have full write access.

## Queries, Discussion
Use the **[Issues](https://github.com/datameet-pune/interns/issues)** section to post any queries or discussions. Check it out time and again to answer queries posted by others. Feel free to ask even the most basic questions, like "how can I filter the table in excel by taluka code?" and even the most cryptic. We hope to see a lot of peer-to-peer learning here.

## Documentation
Use the **[Wiki](https://github.com/datameet-pune/interns/wiki)** section to post your documentation. We expect you to follow the guidelines as [given here](https://github.com/datameet-pune/datameet-pune.github.io/wiki/Tasks-for-Interns#some-things-to-take-care-of-first).
